Hello everyone! Recently I am working for my Bachelor's thesis on Auto Machine Learning.
I want to invite those who are working with Python and Machine Learning tasks to evaluate my first release of the AutoMLWrapper.
AutoMLWrapper library can offer several advantages to the user:

1) Automatic big-data handling using samling
2) Automatic unseen-value handling using unique values
3) Automatic missing-value handling beside remove, replace and impute
4) Automatic detection of dataset's columns types beside string, numeric and categorical
5) Automatic detection of machine learning problem beside classification and regression
6) Automatic algorithm detection beside lot of algorithms
7) Automatic hyperparameter detection for the gived dataset and algorithm
